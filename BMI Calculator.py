# Instructions
# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
#
# The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.
#
# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

#
# Warning you should convert the result to a whole number.
#
# Example Input
# weight = 80
# height = 1.75
# Example Output
# 80 Ã· (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837

#
# Hint
# Check the data type of the inputs.
# Try to use the exponent operator in your code.
# Remember PEMDAS.
# Remember to convert your result to a whole number (int).
