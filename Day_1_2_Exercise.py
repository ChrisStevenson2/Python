# print("Day 1 - String Manipulation)
# what was wrong - missing "

print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")

# print("String Concatenation is done with the " "+" "sign.")
# what was wrong - changed double quotes (") to single quotes (') at the ends of the print statement to inclue the + sign
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')

#  <tab> or <spaces> print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
# what was wrong - indentation Error - print was not at the beginning of the line
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')

# print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
# what was wrong - extra parenthesis at the beginning of the print statement
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
