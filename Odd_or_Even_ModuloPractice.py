#Odd or Even
#Instructions
#Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.
#
#Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.
#
#e.g. 86 is even because 86 Ã· 2 = 43
#
#43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.
#
#e.g. 59 is odd because 59 Ã· 2 = 29.5
#
#29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.
#
#The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division.
#
#e.g.
#
#6 Ã· 2 = 3 with no remainder.
#
#6 % 2 = 0
#
#5 Ã· 2 = 2 x 2 + 1, remainder is 1.
#
#5 % 2 = 1
#
#14 Ã· 4 = 3 x 4 + 2, remainder is 2.
#
#14 % 4 = 2
#
#Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.
#
#Example Input 1
#
#43
#
#Example Output 1
#This is an odd number.
#
#Example Input 2
#
#94
#
#Example Output 2
#This is an even number.
#e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:

#
#Hint
#All even numbers can be divided by 2 with 0 remainder.
#Try some using the modulo with some odd numbers e.g.
#3 % 2
#
#5 % 2
#
#7 % 2
#
#Then try using the modulo with some even numbers e.g.
#
#4 % 2
#
#6 % 2
#
#8 % 2
#
#See what's in common each time.
