        'After two AI winters and ongoing battles for academic funding, we have entered a golden age in industry employment. Complex databases, fast and affordable processing units, and advanced algorithms have rejuvenated established fields of human expertise in mathematics, statistics, computer programming, graphics and visualization as well as good old problem-solving skills. In a global job market steadily automated and simplified by Web 2.0 technology, the field of machine learning provides a professional nirvana for human ingenuity and meaningful work. Itâ€™s a cognitively demanding occupation; one that goes far beyond tuning ad campaigns or tracking web traffic on side-by-side monitors. With jobs in this industry demanding expertise in three distinct fields, achieving machine intelligence is far from easy and demands a high level of expertise. The ideal skillset for a machine learning developer spans coding, data management, and knowledge of statistics and mathematics. Optional areas of expertise include data visualization, big data management, and practical experience in distributed computing architecture.'
        'For writers, a random sentence can help them get their creative juices flowing. Since the topic of the sentence is completely unknown, it forces the writer to be creative when the sentence appears. There are a number of different ways a writer can use the random sentence for creativity. The most common way to use the sentence is to begin a story. Another option is to include it somewhere in the story. A much more difficult challenge is to use it to end a story. In any of these cases, it forces the writer to think creatively since they have no idea what sentence will appear from the tool.',
        'The goal of Python Code is to provide Python tutorials, recipes, problem fixes and articles to beginner and intermediate Python programmers, as well as sharing knowledge to the world. Python Code aims for making everyone in the world be able to learn how to code for free. Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.',
        'As always, we start with the imports. Because we make the UI with tkinter, we need to import it. We also import the font module from tkinter to change the fonts on our elements later. We continue by getting the partial function from functools, it is a genius function that excepts another function as a first argument and some args and kwargs and it will return a reference to this function with those arguments. This is especially useful when we want to insert one of our functions to a command argument of a button or a key binding.'
